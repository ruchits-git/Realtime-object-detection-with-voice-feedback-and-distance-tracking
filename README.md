**VISION PI**

Visually impaired people faces the one problem that no human should face which is the lack of vision in their eyes. With all the technological innovations and exponential research taking place now-a-days, an attempt is made to eliminate inconveniences in day-to-day life. In order to address challenges and provide assistance to visually impaired individuals, this project aims to develop an object detection system specifically tailored to their needs. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms, the model seeks to enhance their object recognition capabilities. They have difficulty in recognizing simple objects and cannot easily distinguish objects with similar shapes.This project aims at creating an object detection system which uses the created dataset to predict the object categories accompanied by distance calculation and audio feedback. Our main highlight is to address the difficulties faced by blind people for navigation. With the help of advancement in Computer Vision, a system can be generated that can identify objects in real time and which will give voice feedback to users. By 
using deep learning and computer vision models and integrating them into a hardware component which will 
help visually impaired people to detect objects with more accuracy in their daily lives. As research tackles 
these hurdles, real-time object detection is poised to unlock a future of smarter, safer, and more immersive experiences for all. A device which is compact and can be used easily and help the users who uses them. A device which can act as a ‘third eye’ to the visually impaired people to solve some of their object detection problems.
